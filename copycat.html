                            <h3><b>Solution of the first riddle: The doctor is the mother</b></h3> <br>
                            <b>Explanation:</b> The difficulty in this riddle was that for some non-english speakers (like german and luxembourgish people), there is a masculine and feminine form of doctor.
                            And the masculine form sounds very close to 'doctor'. So it is easy to assume that the doctor has to be masculine.

                            <h3><b>Solution of the second riddle: A human</b></h3>
                            <b>Explanation:</b> In this riddle the time of the day is a metaphor for the stages of life in a human. In greek myth, a sphinx asked Oedipus this riddle.
                            He answered the riddle correctly: “The answer is `man`. A man crawls on all fours in the morning of his life, he walks on two feet in the midday of his life, and he uses a cane for extra support when he is old.”
                            <br>
                            Note that, while inspired from it, the greek sphinx is not the same as the egyptian sphinx.

                            <h3><b>Solution of the third riddle: A river</b></h3> <br>
                            <b>Explanation:</b> The riddle uses terminology related to rivers: <br>
                            <i>What always runs but never walks.</i>: A river is constantly flowing, or running, but it never walks since it is a body of water. <br>
                            <i>Often murmurs, never talks.</i>: The sound of a river is often described as a murmur, as it makes a continuous low, soft sound.
                                However, a river doesn't talk because it doesn't have a voice or the ability to communicate. <br>
                            <i>Has a bed but never sleeps.</i>: A river has a bed, which is the channel it flows through. However, a river doesn't sleep because it's always flowing. <br>
                            <i>An open mouth that never eats?</i>: A river has a mouth, which is the place where it empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean.
                                This mouth is typically wide open, but a river never eats because it's not alive and doesn't have a digestive system.

                            <h3><b>Solution of the last riddle: Time</b></h3> <br>
                            <b>Explanation:</b> Line by line: <br>
                            <i>I'm a thief that cannot be caught,</i>: This line suggests that the answer is something that takes something away, but is not tangible.<br>
                            <i>Stealing moments that cannot be bought.</i>: Since it is impossible to regain lost time.<br>
                            <i>I'm the reason for the rising sun,</i>: This line suggests that the answer is something that is closely related to the passage of time, and specifically to the cycle of day and night.<br>
                            <i>And the setting of the day when it's done.</i>: This line completes the previous line and reinforces the idea that the answer is related to the passage of time and the cycle of day and night.<br>
